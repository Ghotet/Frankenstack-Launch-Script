# Frankenstack-Launch-Script
Launch and Kill scripts for my AI Stack as detailed on dev.to/ghotet

Some lines in the Launch script don't actually do anything such as the model selector at the top of the LM Studio portion at the beginning of the script.

The kill script leaves my cloudflare tunnel going but otherwise seems to work properly.

These are example scripts as they are set up for my PC and directories and won't just run as is if you download it.
